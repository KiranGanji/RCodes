## My RCodes repository

I write a lot of codes for many of my data analysis and model building. So I thought of putting all of them at one place so as to not rewrite them again and again. For anyone who wishes to use my codes, make modifications etc. please do so. I wont mind.

### Current code lists:

1. UniBiTriCuts.R:
	* This R file has the code to get counts of different combinations of levels within of factor variables. 

2. ChiSq_Vis.R:
	* Visualising ChiSq p-values like the correlation matrix using corrplot library. Requires tidyr package as well.

3. Scrapers:
	* Scrapers of Different websites. Currently for 5 and include: Accuweather, DistrictsofIndia, IMDB, The Economist and XKCD.
